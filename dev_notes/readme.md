So i want to implement multi-task learning with td3+HER for goal conditioned environments such as panda or gymnasium robotics (fetch) envs.  

so i have a couple of ideas. can you tell me which is correct, which is wrong and what would be the best option. Take your time to read and understand the problem.

currently i have a working TD3+HER+MPI based code that is working and i'm thinking of updating that to implement this

1) Simplest Solution

In this one, I'm only going to work with envs with the same action and observation spaces such as fetch push, pnp and slide so the implementation is easier.

Since my code is MPI based i typically run the code like this

```bash

mpiexec -np 6 td3_train.py --cuda --n-cycles=10

```

and inside looks like this

```python
def launch(args):
    # create the ddpg_agent
    env = gym.make(args.env_name)
    # set random seeds for reproduce
    seed = (args.seed + MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank())
    random.seed(args.seed + MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank())
    np.random.seed(args.seed + MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank())
    torch.manual_seed(args.seed + MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank())
    if args.cuda:
        torch.cuda.manual_seed(args.seed + MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank())
    # get the environment parameters
    env_params = get_env_params(env)
    # create the ddpg agent to interact with the environment
    ddpg_trainer = ddpg_agent(args, env, env_params, seed)
    ddpg_trainer.learn()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # take the configuration for the HER
    os.environ['OMP_NUM_THREADS'] = '1'
    os.environ['MKL_NUM_THREADS'] = '1'
    os.environ['IN_MPI'] = '1'
    # get the params
    args = get_args()
    launch(args)
```
so the idea is 
- instead of one env, i will have multiple envs
- so if i have 3 env, i can have two processes for each env since i have 6 processes
- so according to each "MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()" i can assign a different env to each process
- same td3 code no difference after updating the grads for each process i used the following (not a new code as it was already a part of my original code) to sync the networks across the different cores

```python
 sync_networks across the different cores
def sync_networks(network):
    """
    netowrk is the network you want to sync

    """
    comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
    flat_params = _get_flat_params_or_grads(network, mode='params')
    comm.Bcast(flat_params, root=0)
    # set the flat params back to the network
    _set_flat_params_or_grads(network, flat_params, mode='params')


def sync_grads(network):
    flat_grads = _get_flat_params_or_grads(network, mode='grads')
    comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
    global_grads = np.zeros_like(flat_grads)
    comm.Allreduce(flat_grads, global_grads, op=MPI.SUM)
    # todo: get the average grads
    global_grads /= comm.Get_size()
    _set_flat_params_or_grads(network, global_grads, mode='grads')


# get the flat grads or params
def _get_flat_params_or_grads(network, mode='params'):
    """
    include two kinds: grads and params

    """
    attr = 'data' if mode == 'params' else 'grad'
    return np.concatenate([getattr(param, attr).cpu().numpy().flatten() for param in network.parameters()])


def _set_flat_params_or_grads(network, flat_params, mode='params'):
    """
    include two kinds: grads and params

    """
    attr = 'data' if mode == 'params' else 'grad'
    # the pointer
    pointer = 0
    for param in network.parameters():
        getattr(param, attr).copy_(torch.tensor(flat_params[pointer:pointer + param.data.numel()]).view_as(param.data))
        pointer += param.data.numel()
```

2) Another simple solution

Now instead of each process having a different env, i send all the envs to all the processes as below

```python
def get_env_params(env):
    obs, _ = env.reset()
    params = {'obs': obs['observation'].shape[0],
              'goal': obs['desired_goal'].shape[0],
              'action': env.action_space.shape[0],
              'action_max': env.action_space.high[0],
              'max_timesteps': env._max_episode_steps}
    return params

def launch(args):
    
    env_names = ['FetchPush-v2', 'FetchPickAndPlace-v2', 'FetchSlide-v2']  # fetch environments
    
    envs = []
    env_params = []

    # create environments
    for env_name in env_names:
        env = gym.make(env_name)
        envs.append(env)
        env_params.append(get_env_params(env))

    # set random seeds for reproducibility
    seed = args.seed + MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
    random.seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    if args.cuda:
        torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)
        # set the same random seed for all the gpus
        # torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
        # torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

    # create the multi_td3_agent to interact with the environments
    multi_td3_trainer = td3_agent(args, envs, env_params, env_names, seed)
    multi_td3_trainer.learn()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ['OMP_NUM_THREADS'] = '1'
    os.environ['MKL_NUM_THREADS'] = '1'
    os.environ['IN_MPI'] = '1'
    args = get_args_vanilla()
    launch(args)
```

So inside each process i can do two things
- create one main actor-critic network and train on all the envs ( so one optimizer for all the envs)
- but create separate buffers for each env to store the transitions (not sure if this is the correct way to do it)
- randomly select an env and train on it
- or train one env, update the policy then move to the next env and train on it and so on (a loop)
- in either of these approach, at each update sync the networks across the different cores since i'm using MPI

3) More complex solution

Same with previous solution we send all the envs to all the processes 
- but instead of having one main actor-critic network, we have separate actor-critic networks 
- So if i have 3 envs, i will have 3 actor-critic networks and 3 optimizers.
- we also have separate buffers for each env to store the transitions
- we also have a main actor-critic network that we copy weights from at each loop

So this is the idea
- so basically we do a loop over each env or use multiprocessing (not sure we can do that with MPI) to train on each env.
- at the beginning of each loop we copy the weights from the main actor-critic network to the current actor-critic network
- after we loop over all the envs (or multiprocessing)we update the main actor-critic network with the average of the gradients from all the envs
- then we sync the networks across the different cores
- then we repeat the process

4) More complex solution (not sure if this is correct)

Same with previous solution we send all the envs to all the processes 
- we only have one actor-critic network and one optimizer
- we have separate buffers for each env to store the transitions
- we randomly select (not sure a good idea) an env or loop over all and use the same actor-critic network to pick actions and store transitions
- then after we are done with storing transitions, we calculate the loss for each env 
- then we aggregate the losses and update the actor-critic network, sync the grads across like below (not sure if this is correct)

```python
    def outer_loop(self, tasks):

        # increase the global step
        self.global_step += 1

        for env_idx in tasks:
            # update the inner networks
            self.inner_loop(env_idx)  # sample transitions

        for _ in range(self.args.n_batches):
            total_actor_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, dtype=torch.float32)
            total_critic_loss1 = torch.tensor(0.0, dtype=torch.float32)
            total_critic_loss2 = torch.tensor(0.0, dtype=torch.float32)

            if self.args.cuda:
                total_actor_loss = total_actor_loss.cuda()

                total_critic_loss2 = total_critic_loss2.cuda()

            # calculate the meta loss for each environment
            for env_idx in tasks:
                actor_loss, critic_loss1, critic_loss2= self.compute_loss(env_idx)
                if self.args.debug:

                    # print meta_actor_loss so we can check if it has gradient tracking
                    print(f"actor_loss: {actor_loss.requires_grad}")
                    print(f"critic_loss1: {critic_loss1.requires_grad}")
                    print(f"critic_loss2: {critic_loss2.requires_grad}")

                # Accumulate losses
                total_actor_loss += actor_loss
                total_critic_loss1 += critic_loss1
                total_critic_loss2 += critic_loss2

            # Average the losses across tasks
            total_actor_loss /= len(tasks)
            total_critic_loss1 /= len(tasks)
            total_critic_loss2 /= len(tasks)

            if self.args.debug:
                print(
                    f"total_critic_loss1: {total_critic_loss1}, total_critic_loss2: {total_critic_loss2}, total_actor_loss: {total_actor_loss}")

```

What do you think which one is correct? which one is wrong? what would be the best option?

Start with the easiest one the implement? 

My main goal is this. I want to dynamically lean which env to learn first while learning multiple task. 
So the idea is that once we have learned one env, we can use that knowledge to learn the next env faster using fine-tuning or transfer learning.
we can also apply LORA (microsoft) to make the learning faster.

So the challenge is to understand how to capture which is learning better than the other and how to use that knowledge to learn that task first.
such as in case of updating the policy, instead of adding the grads together and getting the average, we can give more weight to the task that is learning faster.

Can you tell me is my idea is correct to identify which one is learning faster
- Lower loss means learning faster
- higher gradient means there is more learning happening

now if we know these things how we can use this to update the policy to learn that task first?
- can we use NN to predict the weights for each task and then use that to update the policy?
- or are there easy method to check our approach is correct?
